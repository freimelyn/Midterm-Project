        <strong>The sedate rural coastal village of Pagudpud Ilocos Norte is located on the most Northern tip of the main
        island of Luzon, and lies about 45 miles from Laoag City, the capital of Ilocos Norte. It is 350 miles
        north of Manila, so you can drive, catch a bus or take a flight to Laoag City and then a  bus or private transport.
        The village is located to the north of Bangui and its windmills, and inland lies the massive Cordillera
        Mountain Range, the largest in the Philippines. Over the other side of the range lies the province of 
        Cagayan. To the North and the West are the warm waters of the South China Sea.The pure white sands of 
        Saud Beach are at Pagudpud Ilocos Norte and it’s often called the Boracay of the North! We say it is 
        Boracay as it once was! And that’s why it’s so popular. Boracay as it was 25 years ago!</strong>

        <strong>
            Pagudpud lies majestically fronting the South 
            China Sea and protected by beautiful green mountains. It is most known for a two-kilometer 
            white beach in Saud, one of the town's barangays.  A row of coconut trees along Saud Beach adds a 
            tropical theme to the already beautiful resort destination that is Pagudpud. 
            Several resorts are located at the Saud white beach, which attracts both foreign and local 
            tourists.  The fine, white cream sand in Saud beach can be compared to those of popular resort 
            islands such as Boracay, Panglao, and Puerto Galera. The water, however, is not as calm as in 
            Boracay and can be suddenly deep during high tide.
